## What is BigBrotr?

**BigBrotr** is a production-ready, modular system for archiving and monitoring the [Nostr protocol](https://nostr.com) ecosystem. Built with Python 3.9+ and PostgreSQL 16+, it provides comprehensive tools for relay discovery, health monitoring, and event synchronization across both clearnet and Tor networks.

BigBrotr follows a **three-layer architecture** that separates concerns and enables maximum flexibility:
- **Core Layer**: Reusable infrastructure components (connection pooling, database interface, logging)
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and service orchestration (Finder, Monitor, Synchronizer)
- **Implementation Layer**: Deployment-specific configuration (BigBrotr full-featured, LilBrotr lightweight)

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Relay Discovery" icon="magnifier">
    Automatically discover Nostr relays from public APIs (nostr.watch) and seed lists. Track over **8,800+ relays** across clearnet and Tor networks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Health Monitoring" icon="heart">
    Continuous NIP-11 and NIP-66 compliance testing with round-trip time (RTT) measurements. Monitor relay capabilities: openable, readable, writable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event Synchronization" icon="rocket">
    High-performance multicore event collection using `aiomultiprocess`. Incremental sync with per-relay timestamp tracking for efficient updates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tor Network Support" icon="shield">
    Full support for `.onion` relay addresses via SOCKS5 proxy. Separate timeout configurations for Tor relays.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Deduplication" icon="document">
    Content-addressed storage for NIP-11/NIP-66 documents. BYTEA storage for event IDs provides **50% space savings** vs hex strings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SQL Analytics" icon="seti:db">
    Pre-built views for statistics, event analysis, and relay metrics. Ready-to-query analytics without complex SQL.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Two Implementations, One Codebase

BigBrotr's architecture enables multiple deployment configurations from the same codebase:

| Implementation | Storage | Tor Support | Use Case |
|----------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **BigBrotr** | Full (id, pubkey, created_at, kind, tags, content, sig) | Enabled | Complete archiving with full event data |
| **LilBrotr** | Essential (id, pubkey, created_at, kind, sig) | Disabled | Lightweight indexing without heavy content |

Both implementations index all events - LilBrotr simply omits the storage-heavy `tags` and `content` fields, saving ~60% disk space while retaining core event metadata for analytics and queries.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python 3.9+** | Primary programming language |
| **PostgreSQL 16+** | Primary data storage with PGBouncer pooling |
| **asyncpg** | High-performance async PostgreSQL driver |
| **Pydantic** | Configuration validation and type safety |
| **aiomultiprocess** | Multicore async processing |
| **Docker** | Containerized deployment |
